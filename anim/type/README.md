Pull Requests

Please consider these points before creating a new pull request

- Pull request should be made from `develop` to `develop` branch so it can be tested properly and not be directly available to download on the `master`.
The `master` branch should be a copy of the latest released `tag` without any additional new code that has not been released
- Add a descriptive note along with the PR and examples
- Only submit the changed lines and not the whole file(s)
- Follow the same coding conversions
